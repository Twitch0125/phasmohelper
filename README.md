# Phasmohelper
A tool to assist you in Ghost Hunting.
**Pull Requests Welcome** (there are typos everywhere...)

## Why?
The idea for this is to provide releveant and helpful information in a user friendly and accessible manner regarding the gameplay of Phasmophobia
(Really I'm working on this because I hate Fandom wikis, especially on Mobile devices so hopefully this will be just as helpful but meach easier to use)

## Build Setup

```bash
# install dependencies
$ yarn install

# serve with hot reload at localhost:3000
$ yarn dev

# build for production and launch server
$ yarn build
$ yarn start

# generate static project
$ yarn generate
```
