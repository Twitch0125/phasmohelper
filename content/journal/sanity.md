# A Hunters Sanity

In your investigation into the supernatural you will need to make sure your sanity is kept high. All types of Ghosts prey on our Sanity making them stronger the more insane we become.
To keep your Sanity high around the paranormal make sure you stay in lit areas.
The digital clock in the truck shows you how long you have before the Ghost will get angry and lower your sanity faster, use this time to find the Ghost and setup equipment. If your Sanity becomes too low the recommended action is to leave.
